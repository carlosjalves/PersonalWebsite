            <p>Winning proposal of the contest "Design da Empena de Divulgação do Ranking The University Impact Rankings". An initiative of the Rectory of the University of Coimbra that aimed to encourage creativity and value creation through the talent of the student community of the UC.<br><br>
                This work was exhibited in the left side wall of the Mathematics Department of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra, in Polo I.<br><br>
                For this project I decided that green and white should be the dominant colors, because in my opinion they give an environmental/sustainable meaning to the project. To represent the University of Coimbra I did an illustration of the University Tower and a student with the academic suit. To portray the importance of sustainability to the University I decided to involve the letters and illustrations with the leaves of the background image, which in my opinion strengthened the meaning of the message.

            <p>This installation is a medium where the body expression is combined with creative expression, allowing us to explore the capacity and limits of the program. It is a space for reflection of computational art and "human" art, and where the line between the two can be found.<br><br>
                The projection consists of a "brush" created with lines through the user's movement, the camera view, discreetly in the background, and two indicators of the design's classification. The user's movement is captured through the camera using nose position tracking. The fact that the user can see his silhouette behind the drawing makes the user part of it and aware of his/her body movement, which gives expressiveness and intimacy to the design. When no one is present, the machine tries to imitate human behavior by drawing (autonomous drawing) even if the body is no longer present.<br><br>
                The program will classify the drawing, whether it is made by a human or a a computer, trying to understand what is being drawn and giving a value of confidence with which it does this classification.</p>

            <p>This project had as main purpose the practical application of Interaction Design concepts, tools and processes. It consisted in the design of a prototype of an application for mobile devices directed to the theme "Europeana" contributing or re-using content from the Europeana repository.<br><br>
                In order to introduce a new dynamism between people and to promote healthy, fun and friendly relationships, where users can spend quality time, we decided to create a game: "Artican" where users are challenged to recreate pieces of art through their body and photo registration, which will later be analyzed by a scanning system that will evaluate the compatibility between the player's photo and the artwork. This application exposes a variety of works of art: sculptures, drawings and paintings from Europeana's website. Besides entertaining the user, it encourages his curiosity about several works of art and develops analysis and synthesis skills in a "soft" and fun way, providing good moments in group and a healthy competitive spirit.</p>

            <p>The main purpose of this project was the practical application of knowledge and skills about technologies needed for web development.<br><br>
                The main characteristic of this project is to be an institutional website and we chose a museum, more specifically the Machado de Castro National Museum. We decided that it would be interesting to create a website for this kind of institution and while doing the research work, we found that there were some flaws in the Machado de Castro National Museum website that could be improved visually and in terms of clarity, making it simpler and more intuitive. In fact, the most relevant information of a museum is its location, its history and mission, its collections, exhibitions, price list, opening hours and the possibility for the user to communicate with museum workers, and so, these will be the most prominent elements.</p>

            <p>This collaborative project involved an adaptation of the short stories from Max Aub's book "Crimes Exemplares" in order to insert the reader into a visual and typographic investigation so that a complete reading becomes possible.<br><br>
                The book loses the limits defined by the pages and the sense of reading, because to understand the tales it is necessary to fit the key cards that are hidden and shuffled in a velvet box at the end of the book, and once placed correctly they unveil the totality of the illustrations and text.<br><br>
                This project also has a multimedia adaptation where the user explores a "soundscape" by navigating with the mouse cursor and listening to different binaural audios in order to be transported through sound into the environment of the crime and experience the sound that precedes the murder.</p>
