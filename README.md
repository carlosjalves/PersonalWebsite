# Personal Website

For this academic exercise, I was tasked with creating a personal presentation website with the goal of developing programming skills with a high level of aesthetic rigor and an experimental character. I began by researching and analyzing some personal portfolio websites, primarily on hoverstat.es. I selected a few that served as references for the creation of my website, following the model I had envisioned: a simple website but with interactive elements for user engagement.

My personal website includes three pages: Homepage, About, and Work.

I decided it was important to include a personal touch on the homepage, so I created a p5.js script that reveals an image of my face as the user moves the cursor across the screen. It's a simple feature, but it engages the user and already offers a glimpse of who I am.

On the About page, I created a “game” where the user must complete a text about me to unlock access to my social media profiles. The text has five blanks and five words scattered on the screen; the user needs to drag the words to the correct spaces. If they get it wrong, the game resets. This ensures that visitors to my personal website will indeed learn something more about me.

Regarding the Work page, it showcases some of my projects and includes an interaction representing the beginning of each project—essentially, a blank sheet of paper and a pencil/marker for sketching initial ideas. The background of the page represents white paper, and the cursor's position acts as the pencil/marker, drawing as the user moves the cursor across the screen. When hovering over each project image, a description of the project appears.
